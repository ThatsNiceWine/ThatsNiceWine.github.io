                    So you like good wine, but find it hard to choose when faced
                    with rows of bottles in the supermarket aisle and countless
                    wine newsletters in your email inbox . Do you go with the
                    shiny medals, or what’s on special that week?
                </p>

                <p>
                    Let me help. I’m here to take the hassle and disappointment
                    out of finding wine that you like, at the best price – and
                    I’ll arrange for it to be delivered promptly to your door.

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Let me know what you like/don’t like, and what your
                        budget is, by answering a few questions via email.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Based on your preferences and budget, I will then scout
                        the best offers online, and put together a box of mixed
                        wines for you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I will let you know the cost of your order, including
                        freight and my fee, and you pay by direct credit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once I receive payment, your wine will arrive at your
                        home or work within a week.
                    </li>
                    <li>Get back in touch with me when you need a top up.</li>

                <p>
                    There’s a lot of great wine out there, and some good deals –
                    I will find them for you!

                        <p>
                            My name is Jake Lindesay, and I have worked as a
                            personal wine broker in NZ and Australia for over
                            ten years. I pride myself on matching vast varieties
                            of wine to each individual’s tastes, and budget. I
                            believe in value for money and that there are
                            excellent wines in all grape varieties... if you
                            know where to find them.
                        </p>
                        <p>Cheers!</p>
