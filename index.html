                            aisle and countless wine newsletters in your email
                            inbox. Do you go with the shiny medals, or what’s on
                            special that week?
                        </p>

                            disappointment out of finding wine that you like, at
                            the best price – and I’ll arrange for it to be

                            My name is Jake Lindesay, and I have worked as a
                            personal wine broker in NZ and Australia for over
                            ten years. I pride myself on matching vast varieties
                            of wine to each individual’s tastes, and budget. I
                            believe in value for money and that there are
                            excellent wines in all grape varieties... if you
                            know where to find them.
